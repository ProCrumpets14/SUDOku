## Commands
![SUDOku Commands](https://github.com/furSUDO/SUDOku/blob/master/github/commands.png?raw=true)
As SUDOku is still in active development, new commands are added all the time, however you may not be able to view some of them, because they are secret ;p

Here is a list of active commands

| command | usage | description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| prefix  |``su!prefix``|changes the prefix of the bot|
|         |       |             |
|         |       |             |

## SUDOku is open source... kinda?

While the main code is fully downloadable and editable, things like commands stay a secret

## Running your own version of SUDOku

Running your own version, or using SUDOku as a base discord bot is as easy as cloning the repository, or downloading it as a zip

before we begin, make sure you have node installed on your system, you can check if you do by running ``node -v`` in the command line

once you have the main files installed run:
```
npm i
```
This will install all the dependencies that SUDOku needs

when all the dependencies have installed, run: ```node .``` to run the project. The first time you run ``node .`` you will be asked to edit the newly generated ``config.json`` file. 

In this file you will need to replace the token key with your bot token, which can be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
